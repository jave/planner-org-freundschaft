* Planner Org Freundschaft
POF is a bunch of settings and some code to help me convert Planner
files to Org files. These are my notes about using POF as well as
background about my planning habits.

** background
Planner[fn:1] has served me well for many years. Now I need a couple of Org[fn:2]
features so I'm converting my Planner directory to Org. Both systems
are based on Outline mode, so conversion isn't too painful so far.

I have used a loose text file system since the mid-nineties. Many of
those files were never converted properly to Planner. This means that
pof has a lot of code geared towards converting badly formated files
to Org. 

For some forgotten reason I found it amusing to write my
very early notes as letters to myself, and use "findings" in the file
names.

Earlier than the Findings system I used up a lot of paper doing
research notes and stuff. I use my Emsane.el[fn:3] project to scan
these notes. 

99.99% of my many amazing plans never come
to fruition but writing down ideas at least lets me move on to other
ideas rather than having random stuff bouncing about in my brain. I
use note-writing as a kind of swap-space one might say.

Spending too much time planning rather than producing is essentialy a
form of procrastination. I use my zen-mode.el[fn:4] project to manage other
forms of procrastination and try to accept planning as the least
wasteful form.

Another thing that always frustrated me with Planner was the lack
of a visual mind-map overview. I use my project Inkmacs[fn:5] for that
now. 
*** Why Org over planner then?
At the outset I just needed property drawers for my Inkmacs[fn:5]
project. I was quite wary of converting because I thought Planner
served me quite well. In the end it became an interesting challenge
and so far I've been able to convert incrementally slowly gaining new
improvements in my planning workflow.

** converting Planner tasks to Org todos
(global-set-key [f6] 'pof-convert-next-planner-task)

It tries its best to figure out closing dates for closed tasks but
often it has to guess. If the close dates are important to you be
extra vigilant in checking the dates.

also note that there is a difference between converting on a day page
or a project page.

** merging many org files
There didn't seem to be any support in Org to merge files:
http://www.mail-archive.com/emacs-orgmode@gnu.org/msg36652.html

Im not so concerned with performance but I do want a structure that is
easy to navigate. The Planner structure I have has too many files and
I need to merge a number of them in a controlled manner.

I use pof-merge-dired-files for my merges. I select files in dired and
select the output buffer. Input files are demoted before the
merge. Headers are constructed so the structure isn't lost.

*** day pages
ive got so many day pages now so ins unwieldy. they shall be converted
to org and merged.

This went rather well with pof-merge-dired-files and some of the
cleanup support I made. Its a lot of manual work but not too bad even
for 2K files.

*** what to merge?
its kind of difficult to see how to convert my existing structure to
org. With planner i had gazilionz of rathr unstructured files and used
rgrep a lot. this works surprisingly well. its not hard to enter
information and its not hard to find, to a point.

with org im aiming to improve the hierarchichal dimension and use tags
for the linking.

i still find it pretty agonizing to merge files. not because its
difficult but because its hard to decide the hierarchies.



** more priorities
In planner I used priorities ABC. I wound up with too much being
priority A. With Org I changed to allow more priorities then I down
shifted all task priorities one step with this macro:
<S-down>		;; org-shiftdown
<down>

Then I shifted up the few real A tasks I have.

** calendar
im used to keeping my schedule in planner day pages. sooo 
org-agenda-diary-file should point to journal.org?

importing icalendar events from emails seem to require to use the
diary file as well. hmm.

in org you can scedule a meeting in any file.

** agenda auxiliary information
An agenda can be seen as an aid for making decisions.
Your schedule and task priorities are useful information.
Sometimes it is useful to knew other things in order to set
priorities.

- How much money you have on the bank can be interesting in order to
  know if you can place that order you planned
- The weather might affect your day planning
- Your location might decide what errands to do
*** DONE motd

I usually have a scary motd in my todo list "TIME IS RUNNING OUT".
I implemented it for my custom org agenda with  pof-agenda-motd.
So, a fortune so I'm motivated to read the agenda, then the scariness.

**** DONE [#A] TIME IS RUNNING OUT
     CLOSED: [2011-04-15 Fri 01:46]
**** DONE [#C] motd rather than moving forward motivational task
     CLOSED: [2011-04-15 Fri 01:46]
*** TODO [#C] financial agenda 
Inspired by the easy setup of my custom agenda I want a financial
agenda that will show financial todos and also show account balances.
Of course banks don't offer convenient API:she by default but I had
success with reading the expense account other work at least. I think
bank account information can be scraped anyway.

*** TODO location
query the gps and match task tags

*** TODO [#B] weather
http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EmacsWeather
shew weather in block agenda


* random things I had somewhat working in Planner
** TODO emms org integration
literate dj.
its simply a playlist in org format.

** TODO org erc
** TODO org pdf 
** TODO jdbc urls


* Emacs address books
there are many options. ive been usin bbdb together with planner a lot but its not shiny
anymore, and it cant be included in Emacs.
IMHO it would be nice if ot least abook and org-contacts could cooperate.
** org addressbook
keep contacts in an org file. this solution seems very interesting.
http://julien.danjou.info/org-contacts.html

it would be nice to be able to keep contacs in the different project
files because i do that a lot already because of old habits. but sadly
it seems too slow to use org-contacts this way. A compromise might be
possible by making an explicit list of files to search by greping the
org files once in a while.


*** TODO convert bbdb to org
could maybe be done with a customer bbdb layout
** abook
use standard vcards which is nice.
** bbdb
*** DONE [#B] add bbdb on outgoing email
